### My Self :technologist:
- Master of science in computer science with over 3+ years of professional experience as a Data Engineer.
- Extensive hands-on experience with Hadoop and Spark ecosystems, coupled with a track record of successfully solving 300+ real-world SQL challenges, showcasing a strong analytical and logical reasoning.
- Competent data engineer proficient in Python and SQL, achieving a gold rating on HackerRank.

## Inspiration: 
I possess six things <br>
- Hardwork  : I Dont believe in luck, I believe in hard work.
- Patience  : If you are losing the patience then you are losing the battle.
- Sacrifice : If I dont sacrifice for what I want then what I want becomes the sacrifice.
- Discipline : Motivation gets you going but discipline keeps you growing.
- Self Confidence : They dont like me :x: I'll be fine if they don't like me :white_check_mark:.
- Consistency : Consistency is what transforms average into excellence.

##### My Productivity Hack:
- Instead of spending time getting in the mood to work, Just start working confront the work.People think they need a perfect conditions to start, when in reality starting is the perfect condition.

##### Always Remember:
- Consistency beats Intensity, Discipline beats Motivation, Hardwork beats Talent, Patience builds all.
